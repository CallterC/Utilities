# Utilities
This is a utilities library
These functions are some useful little tools I wrote over the years that make my life a bit easier
Hope you enjoy it.

## Tools
### Image Labeler
This is a tool that opens a UI so that you can label your photos. It also comes with a batch labeler, meaning you get to select multiple images.

### Video Concatenation
Sometimes, when I download videos from websites, video and audio are stored in separate files. To counter this situation, you can use this little tool. Just make sure that you installed FFMPEG before using it.

### OCR
I write a little OCR tool to help you convert any PDF into a text document. In my experience, it should give you around 99% of accuracy. Since it uses AI to convert, you will need to install PaddleOCR in order to use this tool
